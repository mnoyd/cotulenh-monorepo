# Capture in Cotulenh

Capturing removes enemy units and changes the battlefield. Most captures work like chess (move onto the enemy), but Cotulenh adds **stay captures** and special capture cases.

## What You'll Learn

### 1. Normal Capture

- Move onto an enemy square to capture
- Your piece replaces the enemy on that square

### 2. Stay Capture

- Destroy a target **without moving**
- Used by units like **Artillery** and **Air Force**

### 3. Capture Across the River

- The river runs between **ranks 6 and 7**
- Tanks can cross and capture across the river

### 4. Air Force Capture

- Air Force captures within its flight range
- It ignores terrain and blocking
