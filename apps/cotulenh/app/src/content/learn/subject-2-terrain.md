# Terrain in Cotulenh

Terrain shapes every battle. Water is for Navy, land is for ground units, and the river is a boundary that some pieces can cross freely while heavy units must use bridges.

## What You'll Learn

### 1. Water vs Land

- Water squares are on files **a-c**
- Land squares are on files **d-k**
- Navy stays on water, ground units stay on land

### 2. The River and Bridges

- The river runs between **ranks 6 and 7**
- Tanks can cross the river
- Heavy Artillery must use **bridge squares**: **f6/f7** or **h6/h7**

### 3. Mixed Zones

- The **c-file** and **river squares** are shared terrain
- Both Navy and land units can use these squares
