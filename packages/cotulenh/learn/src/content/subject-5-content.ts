# Air Defense in Cotulenh

Air Defense creates invisible danger zones that restrict Air Force movement. Learning these zones is essential for safe flight paths and effective strikes.

## Who Provides Air Defense

- **Anti-Air (G/g)**: Range 1
- **Missile (S/s)**: Range 2
- **Navy (N/n)**: Range 1

Heroic versions extend their air defense range by 1.

## What Happens in Defense Zones

When Air Force moves through enemy air defense coverage:

- **Safe Pass**: No defense encountered → move normally
- **Kamikaze**: Enter a single defense zone → move completes, Air Force is destroyed
- **Destroyed**: Enter multiple zones or exit then re-enter → move is blocked

## Tactical Implications

- **Plan flight paths** to avoid defended squares
- **Accept sacrifices** when a kamikaze strike is worth the target
- **Layer defenses** to deny Air Force access entirely

## What You'll Learn

- Navigate Air Force around air defense coverage
- Identify safe routes to multiple objectives
- Execute a kamikaze capture and see the Air Force removed

Master air defense to control the skies.

# Avoiding Air Defense Zones

Air defense coverage is invisible, but it controls space. Your Air Force must route around protected squares to survive.

Use the targets to practice safe movement around defended areas.

# Kamikaze Captures

If Air Force enters exactly one enemy air defense zone, it can complete its attack but is destroyed afterward.

These lessons demonstrate a successful kamikaze capture and its outcome.
