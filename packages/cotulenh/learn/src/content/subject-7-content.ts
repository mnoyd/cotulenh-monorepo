# Deploying a Stack

Deployment lets a combined piece split into multiple moves. Each piece in a stack can **deploy** to a new square during the same turn.

## Core Rules

- Only pieces from the **same stack** can deploy in a session
- Each deployed piece moves using **its own movement rules**
- The deployment ends when all pieces move, or when the **carrier** deploys last

## What You'll Learn

- Deploy every piece from a stack using rightward steps
- Deploy just one piece and stop the session early
- Deploy the carrier to finish the sequence

Deployment turns one stack into a coordinated multi-piece maneuver.

# Deployment Basics

Start from a combined piece and deploy its passengers one by one.
These lessons focus on deploying cargo to the right in clear steps.

export const section2DeployCarrierIntro = `
# Deploying the Carrier

The carrier can deploy too. Moving it ends the deployment sequence.
Practice finishing a deploy by moving the Air Force carrier.
