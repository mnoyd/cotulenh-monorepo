# Heroic Promotion from Check

When any piece **puts the enemy Commander in check**, it becomes **Heroic**.
Heroic pieces gain upgraded movement and capture abilities.

## Core Rule

- **Give check → become heroic immediately**
- Heroic pieces are marked with a **+** in notation

## What You'll Learn

- Deliver check in one move to trigger heroic promotion
- Use the upgraded movement of the newly heroic piece

export const section2HeroicMovementIntro = `
