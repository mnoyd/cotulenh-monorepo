# Flying General Rule

Commanders may not face each other on a clear file or rank. If they do, either commander can capture the other regardless of distance.

## Core Rule

- Commanders on the **same file or rank** with **no pieces between** are in immediate danger
- Any move that **creates exposure** is illegal

## What You'll Learn

- Why a Commander sometimes cannot capture a nearby target
- How another piece can make the safe capture instead

# Commander Exposure

Keep a blocking piece between commanders. If a capture would clear the line, the move is illegal.
