# Combining Pieces in Cotulenh

Cotulenh lets friendly units stack on the same square to form **combined pieces**. A stack moves as one unit, with a single **carrier** transporting the others.

## Core Rules

- Only **same-color** pieces can combine
- The **carrier** determines movement and terrain restrictions
- Carrier is chosen by **role hierarchy** (Navy > HQ > Engineer > Air Force > Tank > Missile > Anti-Air > Artillery > Militia > Infantry > Commander)

## Allowed Combinations (Blueprints)

- **Navy** can carry **Air Force**, plus a second slot of **Tank or humanlike roles**
- **Air Force** can carry **Tank**, plus a second slot of **humanlike roles**
- **Tank** can carry **humanlike roles**
- **Engineer** can carry **heavy equipment** (Artillery, Anti-Air, Missile)
- **Headquarter** can carry **Commander**

## What You'll Learn

- Basic stack formation by moving onto a friendly piece
- Carrier behavior for special roles like Engineer and Headquarters
- Practical combinations that match the official blueprints

Combine wisely to move faster, protect key pieces, and strike with surprise.
