# Phase 3 Implementation Status

**Date**: October 20, 2025 **Time Invested**: ~2 hours

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Interface Enhancement

- Added `isBatchMode?: boolean` flag to `DeploySession` interface
- Documented batch mode behavior

### 2. Batch Deploy Helper Methods

- ‚úÖ `startBatchDeploySession()` - creates session with batch flag
- ‚úÖ `commitBatchDeploySession()` - atomic commit with single turn switch
- ‚úÖ `rollbackBatchDeploySession()` - error recovery
- ‚úÖ Updated turn switching logic to skip in batch mode

### 3. deployMove() Rewrite

- ‚úÖ Generate move candidates using
  `generateMoveCandidateForSinglePieceInStack()`
- ‚úÖ Validate with `createInternalDeployMove()`
- ‚úÖ Generate SAN/LAN BEFORE execution
- ‚úÖ Execute moves with batch context (preventCommit: true)
- ‚úÖ Commit atomically at end
- ‚úÖ Pass beforeFEN and SAN to DeployMove constructor

### 4. DeployMove Constructor Update

- ‚úÖ Added optional `beforeFEN`, `san`, `lan` parameters
- ‚úÖ Dual path: batch wrapper vs legacy
- ‚úÖ Batch path uses provided values, legacy generates them

## ‚ùå Current Issues

### Issue 1: Move Validation Failures

**Error**: "Deploy move error: move not found"

**Symptoms**:

- Move candidates are being generated (23 candidates for stack at c3)
- Request is valid (e.g., f->c4, t->d3)
- But `createInternalDeployMove()` can't find matching moves

**Debug Output**:

```
[DEBUG] deployMove: Generated 23 move candidates for stack at c3
[DEBUG] deployMove: Request moves: [ 'f->c4', 't->d3' ]
Error: Deploy move error: move not found
```

**Hypothesis**: The move candidates might have different piece structures than
what's requested. The matching logic in `createInternalDeployMove` (lines 96-105
of deploy-move.ts) compares:

- `from` square
- `to` square
- `piece.type`

But the pieces in the generated moves might not match the pieces in the request.

### Issue 2: Original Piece Not Found

**Error**: "Deploy move error: original piece not found"

**Symptoms**:

- Some tests fail because `game.get(deployMove.from)` returns null/undefined
- This suggests the square might already be empty

**Hypothesis**: Tests might be calling `deployMove()` after the stack has
already been deployed, or test setup is incomplete.

### Issue 3: Ambiguous Deploy Move

**Error**: "Deploy move error: ambiguous deploy move. some pieces are not clear
whether moved or stay"

**Symptoms**:

- The validation in `createInternalDeployMove` fails at line 86-89
- Total pieces in moves + stay doesn't equal original stack size

**Hypothesis**: Test might be requesting to move only some pieces without
specifying what happens to the rest.

## üîç Next Steps

### Priority 1: Debug Move Matching Logic

1. Add more detailed logging to `createInternalDeployMove()`
2. Log the generated move candidates structure
3. Log the requested move structure
4. Compare and identify mismatch

### Priority 2: Check Test Setup

1. Verify tests are setting up boards correctly
2. Check if tests expect different behavior from wrapper
3. Review "Virtual State Deploy System" test suite expectations

### Priority 3: Consider Alternative Approach

If move generation is fundamentally incompatible with batch wrapper:

1. Option A: Fix move generation to work with batch wrapper
2. Option B: Use a simpler validation approach for batch deploy
3. Option C: Bypass `createInternalDeployMove` for batch mode

## üìä Test Results

**Current**: 19 failed | 10 passed (29 total) **Target**: 0 failed | 29 passed

**Failed Test Categories**:

- Legacy Deploy System tests: 8 failures
- Virtual State Deploy System tests: 11 failures

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Move Candidate Generation Works**:
   `generateMoveCandidateForSinglePieceInStack()` successfully generates moves

2. **Batch Infrastructure is Solid**: The batch session management, virtual
   state, and turn handling are implemented correctly

3. **Validation is the Bottleneck**: The issue is in the validation/matching
   step between user requests and generated candidates

4. **Two Systems Clash**: The batch wrapper tries to use the existing validation
   logic (`createInternalDeployMove`), but they might have different
   expectations about move structure

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [x] Batch session created successfully
- [x] Virtual state accumulates changes
- [x] Turn switches only once at end
- [ ] Move validation passes
- [ ] All moves execute correctly
- [ ] Tests pass
