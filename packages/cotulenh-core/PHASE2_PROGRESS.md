# Phase 2: Move Generation - Progress

**Started:** 2025-10-15 23:45 UTC+07:00  
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress (Framework Complete, Generators Complete)

---

## ✅ Completed

### Framework (Day 1)

- ✅ **types.ts** - Move generation interfaces (76 lines)
- ✅ **MoveGenerator.ts** - Main orchestrator (90 lines)
- ✅ **BasePieceGenerator.ts** - Base class with helpers (120 lines)
- ✅ **MoveGeneratorFactory.ts** - Factory pattern setup (30 lines)

### All Piece Generators Implemented ✅

1. ✅ **InfantryGenerator** - Orthogonal, 1 square (26 lines)

   - 9 tests passing

2. ✅ **TankGenerator** - Orthogonal, 2 squares, shoot-over (94 lines)
   - Can shoot over one piece to capture beyond
3. ✅ **MilitiaGenerator** - All 8 directions, 1 square (22 lines)

   - Omnidirectional movement

4. ✅ **ArtilleryGenerator** - Orthogonal, 3 squares, ignores blocking (60
   lines)

   - Moves/captures through pieces

5. ✅ **MissileGenerator** - L-shaped knight moves (63 lines)

   - 8 possible knight-like jumps

6. ✅ **AntiAirGenerator** - Orthogonal, 1 square (23 lines)

   - Same as Infantry, provides air defense separately

7. ✅ **CommanderGenerator** - Orthogonal, 1 square, Flying General rule (70
   lines)

   - Cannot face enemy commander on same file

8. ✅ **NavyGenerator** - Orthogonal, 1 square + stay-capture (38 lines)

   - Water/mixed terrain only
   - Can attack without moving

9. ✅ **AirForceGenerator** - Orthogonal, 4 squares, air defense restricted (88
   lines)

   - Cannot move into defended zones
   - Suicide attacks in defended areas or vs Commander

10. ✅ **HeadquarterGenerator** - Immobile unless heroic (25 lines)
    - Only moves if heroic, then 1 square orthogonally

## 📊 Statistics

### Code Written

```
Framework:         316 lines
Piece Generators:  ~509 lines (10 pieces)
Total:             ~825 lines of move generation code
```

### Compilation

- ✅ **TypeScript**: All files compile (strict mode)
- ✅ **Type errors**: 0
- ✅ **Integration**: Works with Phase 1 core

---

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Movement Patterns

- ✅ Single-step (Infantry, AntiAir, Commander)
- ✅ Multi-square slides (Tank, Artillery, AirForce)
- ✅ Knight-like jumps (Missile)
- ✅ Omnidirectional (Militia)
- ✅ Conditional (Headquarter - heroic only)

### Special Rules

- ✅ **Shoot-over** (Tank) - capture through one piece
- ✅ **Ignore blocking** (Artillery) - move through pieces
- ✅ **Flying General** (Commander) - same-file restriction
- ✅ **Stay-capture** (Navy) - attack without moving
- ✅ **Air defense** (AirForce) - restricted by enemy zones
- ✅ **Suicide attacks** (AirForce) - self-destruct captures
- ✅ **Terrain restrictions** - All pieces respect water/land

### Architecture Patterns

- ✅ **Plugin-based** - Register generators dynamically
- ✅ **Direction-based** - Reusable slide/step helpers
- ✅ **Context-driven** - Access to full game state
- ✅ **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript with interfaces

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Deploy Move Generation** (Task 2.3)

   - [ ] Create `DeployMoveGenerator.ts`
   - [ ] Stack splitting logic
   - [ ] Generate all possible deploy combinations
   - [ ] Integrate with DeploySession

2. **Comprehensive Testing** (End of Phase 2)

   - [ ] Test all piece generators (~100 tests)
   - [ ] Test edge cases (board edges, terrain, captures)
   - [ ] Test special rules (shoot-over, flying general, etc.)
   - [ ] Test deploy move generation (~20 tests)
   - [ ] Integration tests

3. **Performance**
   - [ ] Benchmark move generation
   - [ ] Target: <15ms for typical position

## 💡 Design Decisions

### 1. Plugin Architecture

Register generators independently - easy to add new pieces or variants.

### 2. Direction-Based Helpers

`generateSlides()` and `generateSteps()` reduce code duplication.

### 3. Terrain Integration

Used Phase 1's `canPlaceOnSquare()` for consistent terrain validation.

### 4. Air Defense Integration

Integrated existing bitboard air defense calculations for AirForce.

### 5. Type Guards

Used discriminated unions from Phase 1 for move type safety.

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

1. **PieceType vs PieceSymbol** - Fixed type naming inconsistency
2. **Air Defense API** - Adapted to existing `calculateAirDefense()` method
3. **TypeScript Errors** - Fixed property access and type narrowing

**Status**: Framework and all 10 piece generators complete. Ready for deploy
generation and comprehensive testing.
