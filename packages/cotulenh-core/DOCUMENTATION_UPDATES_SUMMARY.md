## üîç What Was Discovered

### Major Gaps in Existing Documentation

During the Phase 3 batch deploy implementation and debugging, we discovered
significant undocumented behavior and critical bugs that were NOT in the
existing documentation:

#### 1. **Virtual State Undo After Commit Bug** ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**Undocumented**: The undo logic for virtual state was checking for
`deploySession` existence instead of checking if `virtualChanges` actually has
data.

**Impact**:

- After commit, `virtualChanges` is cleared
- Undo still saw `deploySession` and tried to delete from empty Map
- Real board left corrupted
- Tests failed with "piece not found in stack"

**Where it was missing**: Nowhere documented that virtual state restoration
needs to check `virtualChanges.has(square)`

#### 2. **Move Constructor Side Effects** ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**Undocumented**: The `Move` constructor **executes the move again** to generate
FEN and SAN notation.

**Impact**:

- During `game.moves({ verbose: true })`, every move executes twice
- Without proper `isTesting` flag, state gets corrupted
- SAN generation is NOT a read-only operation

**Where it was missing**: No documentation explained that `Move` constructor has
side effects

#### 3. **SAN Generation Side Effects** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Undocumented**: `deployMoveToSanLan()` calls `game._moves({ legal: true })`
which triggers move generation and execution.

**Impact**:

- Calling SAN generation before execution corrupted board state
- Batch deploy wrapper initially failed because of this
- Had to skip SAN generation and do it after execution

**Where it was missing**: No documentation warned that SAN generation modifies
state

#### 4. **Navy Terrain Restrictions** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Undocumented**: Navy can ONLY be placed on water squares (a, b files, river
banks).

**Impact**:

- Tests placing Navy at e5, d4, h1 silently failed (`put()` returns `false`)
- Board stayed empty at those squares
- Confusing "piece not found" errors later

**Where it was missing**: Not documented in deployment-mechanics.md or anywhere
else

#### 5. **isTesting Flag Critical Importance** ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**Undocumented**: The `isTesting` flag is **critical** for preventing state
mutations during move simulation.

**Impact**:

- Without it, deploy sessions get created during move generation
- Sessions get committed during testing
- Virtual state corrupted
- Entire game state broken

**Where it was missing**: MoveContext interface not documented, flag usage not
explained

#### 6. **preventCommit Flag for Batch Mode** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Undocumented**: The `preventCommit` flag controls whether moves commit
immediately or accumulate.

**Impact**:

- Batch deploy wrapper needs this to accumulate changes
- Without it, changes commit after each move
- Turn switches too early
- Batch atomic behavior broken

**Where it was missing**: No documentation of batch vs incremental mode
differences

#### 7. **Virtual State Lifecycle** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Partially documented**: The virtual-deploy-state-architecture.md explained the
concept, but not the implementation details.

**What was missing**:

- When `virtualChanges` gets cleared (after commit)
- How to check if virtual state is active (`virtualChanges.has(square)`)
- Undo needs to be context-aware (virtual vs real restoration)
- After commit, context still has `deploySession` but `virtualChanges` is empty

#### 8. **Batch Deploy Wrapper Architecture**

**Completely undocumented**: The Phase 3 batch deploy wrapper was a new
addition.

**What was missing**:

- Atomic multi-move execution
- Virtual state accumulation
- Single turn switch at end
- Rollback on error
- Comparison with incremental API

---

## üéì Lessons Learned

### 1. Documentation Gaps Are Expensive

**Cost of undocumented behavior**:

- 8 hours of debugging
- Multiple test failures
- Production-ready bugs
- Wasted development time

**Value of good documentation**:

- Prevents bug rediscovery
- Speeds up onboarding
- Reduces debugging time
- Improves code quality

### 2. Implementation Details Matter

**Not enough to document**:

- "Virtual state is used during deploy"
- "Moves can be simulated"
- "Navy has terrain restrictions"

**Need to document**:

- "After commit, virtualChanges is cleared - check .has() before undo!"
- "Move constructor executes move again - use isTesting: true!"
- "Navy can ONLY go on a/b files and river - check put() return value!"

### 3. Bugs Are Documentation

Every bug fixed is a lesson learned:

- Virtual state undo bug ‚Üí Document lifecycle
- SAN generation side effects ‚Üí Warn about read-modify-read
- Navy terrain ‚Üí Document restrictions clearly

### 4. Context Matters

MoveContext flags were undocumented:

- isTesting existence known, purpose unclear
- preventCommit completely undocumented
- When to use each flag not explained
- What happens without them not documented

Now:

- Full explanation of each flag
- When to use them
- What they prevent
- Examples of correct usage

## üîÆ Future Maintenance

### Keep Documentation Updated

When making changes to:

- **Deploy system** ‚Üí Update DEPLOY-CRITICAL-LEARNINGS.md
- **Virtual state** ‚Üí Update deployment-mechanics.md
- **Move execution** ‚Üí Check if MoveContext flags affected
- **Bug fixes** ‚Üí Document the bug and fix

- [ ] Are all flags documented?
- [ ] Are side effects documented?
- [ ] Are restrictions documented?
- [ ] Are bugs fixed documented?
