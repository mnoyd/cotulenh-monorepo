# Session Status - Virtual State Context Staleness Fix

**Date**: October 20, 2025, 11:36 PM  
**Status**: Partial Fix Complete - 26/29 tests passing

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### Critical Bug: Virtual State Undo Using Stale Context

**Problem**: Atomic actions were checking `this.context.deploySession` during
both execute() and undo(), which pointed to a stale session object after
`_undoMove()` restored `game._deploySession = null`.

**Impact**: Ghost pieces left on board after undoing moves during Move
constructor testing, causing "No matching legal move found" errors.

**Solution**: All atomic actions now check `this.game.getDeployState()` to get
the CURRENT deploy session state.

### Actions Fixed

‚úÖ **PlacePieceAction**

- `execute()`: Now checks `game.getDeployState()`
- `undo()`: Now checks `game.getDeployState()`
- Added deep copy for `existingPiece` to prevent reference mutations

‚úÖ **RemovePieceAction**

- `execute()`: Now checks `game.getDeployState()`
- `undo()`: Now checks `game.getDeployState()`
- Added deep copy for `removedPiece` to prevent reference mutations

‚úÖ **RemoveFromStackAction**

- Constructor: Saves deep copy of `originalState` to prevent reference mutations
- `execute()`: Now checks `game.getDeployState()`
- `undo()`: Now checks `game.getDeployState()` and restores original state

‚úÖ **UpdateDeploySessionAction**

- `execute()`: Now checks `game.getDeployState()`
- `undo()`: Now checks `game.getDeployState()`

‚úÖ **SingleDeployMoveCommand.buildActions()**

- Now checks `game.getDeployState()` when looking for carrier piece

## ‚úÖ Tests Fixed

1. ‚úÖ **"Generate deploy moves for (NFT) stack"** - NOW PASSING

   - Was failing with "No matching legal move found"
   - Board corruption (Infantry ghosts at c2, d1) fixed
   - Verbose move generation now properly cleans up state

2. ‚úÖ **26 other combined-stack tests** - PASSING

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues

### 3 Deploy Tests Still Failing

1. ‚ùå **"Execute Tank deploy move after Air Force deploy"**

   - Error: No matching legal move found: `{"from":"c3","to":"d3","piece":"t"}`
   - Issue: Second deploy move in session can't find Tank
   - 0 legal moves generated from c3

2. ‚ùå **"Execute Carrier move after all deployments"**

   - Similar issue with multi-move deploy sequences

3. ‚ùå **"check deploy state after all deploy moves"**
   - Deploy state verification failing

### Root Cause Analysis

The remaining failures are all about **multi-move deploy sequences** where:

1. First deploy move works (AF from c3 to c4)
2. Second deploy move fails (Tank from c3 to d3)

The issue appears to be in how the deploy session's virtual state is being read
during move generation for subsequent deploys.

**Hypothesis**: When generating moves for the second deploy,
`generateDeployMoves()` needs to see the virtual state showing:

- c3: Navy carrying only Tank (AF already deployed)
- c4: Air Force (from first deploy)

But it's either:

- Not reading virtual state correctly
- Virtual state not being properly maintained between moves
- Deploy session state corrupted/incomplete

## üîç Next Steps

1. **Debug Virtual State Reading**

   - Add logging to show virtual state during move generation
   - Check if `getEffectiveBoard()` returns correct virtual overlay
   - Verify deploy session's `virtualChanges` map contains correct entries

2. **Check Deploy Session State**

   - Verify deploy session persists between first and second move
   - Check `movedPieces` array is correctly updated
   - Verify `virtualChanges` map after first deploy

3. **Review Move Generation Logic**
   - Check `generateDeployMoves()` uses virtual state
   - Verify it reads from effective board, not raw board
   - Ensure carrier piece lookup uses virtual state

## üìä Test Results

```
combined-stack tests: 26/29 passing (89.7%)
- Deploy generation: ‚úÖ 1/1
- Single deploys: ‚úÖ Multiple passing
- Multi-move deploys: ‚ùå 3/3 failing
- Captures: ‚úÖ All passing
- Combinations: ‚úÖ All passing
```

## üéØ Key Insight

The fix successfully solved the **undo corruption** issue where ghost pieces
persisted after Move constructor testing. Actions now correctly respect the
game's current state during undo.

The remaining issues are about **active deploy session** management during
multi-move sequences, which is a different problem domain than the undo
corruption we just fixed.
