# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating comprehensive documentation
that focuses on two critical aspects:

1. **Complete Game Rules Understanding**: Every single game mechanic, piece
   behavior, terrain interaction, special rule, and edge case must be documented
   in exhaustive detail
2. **External API Usage Pattern**: How external systems interact with the game
   engine through a clean request-response cycle

The documentation must enable perfect understanding and implementation of
CoTuLenh (Cờ Tư Lệnh) chess variant, ensuring zero hidden bugs and complete rule
fidelity. This requires systematic analysis of the interconnected
singleton-pattern codebase to extract pure game logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Exhaustive Game Rules Analysis and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer implementing CoTuLenh, I need to understand every
single game rule, edge case, and mechanic in complete detail so that my
implementation has zero hidden bugs and perfect rule fidelity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing piece types THEN the system SHALL document all 11 piece types
   (COMMANDER, INFANTRY, TANK, MILITIA, ENGINEER, ARTILLERY, ANTI_AIR, MISSILE,
   AIR_FORCE, NAVY, HEADQUARTER) with exact movement patterns, capture rules,
   range limitations, and terrain restrictions
2. WHEN examining terrain system THEN the system SHALL document the exact
   boundaries and rules for water zones, land zones, mixed zones, river
   crossings, and bridge mechanics
3. WHEN understanding piece interactions THEN the system SHALL document
   combination rules, carrying capacity, stack formation rules, deployment
   mechanics, and piece separation rules
4. WHEN analyzing special mechanics THEN the system SHALL document heroic
   promotions (when, how, effects), air defense zones (calculation, effects on
   air force), commander exposure rules, suicide captures, and stay captures
5. WHEN examining game state THEN the system SHALL document turn management,
   deploy phases, game ending conditions, draw rules, and state transitions
6. WHEN understanding data formats THEN the system SHALL document FEN
   construction with stack notation, SAN notation with all special move types,
   and internal state representation

### Requirement 2: External API Usage Pattern Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with CoTuLenh, I need to understand
the exact request-response cycle for game interaction so that I can build
reliable external systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing a game THEN the system SHALL document how to create a game
   instance with FEN, validate the FEN, and handle initialization errors
2. WHEN sending moves THEN the system SHALL document the complete move
   validation process, how moves are executed, and how the updated game state is
   returned
3. WHEN querying game state THEN the system SHALL document how to check for game
   ending conditions, get current FEN, determine whose turn it is, and detect
   check/checkmate
4. WHEN handling move generation THEN the system SHALL document how to get all
   legal moves, filter moves by piece or square, and handle deploy moves
5. WHEN managing game flow THEN the system SHALL document the complete cycle:
   receive move → validate → execute → update state → return new FEN → check
   game end → repeat

### Requirement 3: Systematic Codebase Analysis Strategy

**User Story:** As an analyst studying this interconnected singleton-pattern
codebase, I need a systematic approach to untangle and understand how all
components relate to extract pure game logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing code dependencies THEN the system SHALL map all class
   relationships, singleton patterns, and circular dependencies to understand
   the interconnection web
2. WHEN extracting game rules THEN the system SHALL separate pure game logic
   from implementation artifacts, identifying what is essential vs what is
   architectural choice
3. WHEN tracing game flow THEN the system SHALL follow complete execution paths
   from move input to state update to understand all side effects and state
   changes
4. WHEN identifying edge cases THEN the system SHALL examine test files, error
   conditions, and boundary cases to ensure complete rule coverage
5. WHEN validating understanding THEN the system SHALL cross-reference multiple
   code sections to ensure consistent interpretation of rules and mechanics
