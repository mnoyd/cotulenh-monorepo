# Bitboard Engine: Advanced Considerations & Challenges

This document outlines critical implementation details, potential challenges,
and architectural considerations that must be addressed to ensure the success of
the bitboard engine redesign. While the core bitboard approach is sound, these
aspects are crucial for a practical, maintainable, and truly high-performance
implementation.

### 1. Stack Composition and Carrier Information

- **The Challenge:** The core bitboard model (using one bitboard per piece type)
  efficiently shows _which_ pieces are on a given square, but it does not
  inherently store their relationship within a stack. For example, it can show
  that a Tank and an Infantry are on square `e5`, but it cannot tell which piece
  is the carrier, which is essential for determining the stack's movement rules.

- **The Solution:** The implementation must include a supplemental data
  structure to track stack hierarchy. A hash map is a suitable approach:

  ```typescript
  // A map from a square's index to its stack composition
  let stackInfo: Map<number, { carrier: PieceSymbol; carried: PieceSymbol[] }>
  ```

  This map will be queried whenever a stack is moved or interacted with. It will
  be updated atomically as part of any move that forms, splits, or modifies a
  stack.

### 2. High-Performance Repetition Detection (Zobrist Hashing)

- **The Challenge:** Using FEN strings as keys for tracking position history
  (for the threefold repetition rule) is a major performance bottleneck.
  Generating a full FEN string after every move is a slow, string-intensive
  operation that undermines the speed benefits of a bitboard engine.

- **The Solution:** The engine must implement **Zobrist Hashing**. This is the
  standard and required technique for high-performance chess engines. A Zobrist
  key is a single large number (`bigint` or 64-bit integer) that represents the
  entire board state. Its key advantages are:
  - **Incremental Updates:** When a piece moves, the Zobrist key can be updated
    with a few, lightning-fast XOR operations, rather than a full board
    re-evaluation.
  - **Efficiency:** It provides an extremely fast way to hash and compare board
    states, making repetition detection virtually instantaneous.

### 3. Pre-computation Strategy for Tables

- **The Challenge:** The plan relies on pre-computed tables, especially for
  "magic bitboards." The process of finding these "magic numbers" is
  computationally expensive and can take several seconds or more.

- **The Solution:** A clear strategy for handling this computation cost is
  needed. The two options are:

  1.  **Generate at Startup:** The engine calculates the magic numbers and
      tables every time the application loads. This is simpler to code but
      results in a slow startup time, which is often unacceptable for users.
  2.  **Generate Offline (Recommended):** Run a separate script once during
      development to find the optimal magic numbers. Then, hardcode these
      numbers and the resulting attack tables as constants directly in the
      source code. This is the standard approach. It results in an instantaneous
      startup time at the cost of a larger initial library/application download
      size.

  For a high-performance engine, the recommended path is **offline generation**.

### 4. Debugging and Visualization Tooling

- **The Challenge:** Bitboards are notoriously difficult to debug. A `bigint`
  representing a board is just a massive, unreadable number. Without proper
  tools, development and maintenance will be extremely slow and error-prone.

- **The Solution:** A comprehensive suite of debugging tools is a **mandatory,
  non-negotiable part of the development plan**. This goes beyond a simple
  `printBoard()` function. The tooling must include the ability to:
  - **Visualize any bitboard:** A function that takes any `bigint` and prints it
    as a formatted 12x12 grid.
  - **Inspect a square:** A function that takes a square index and queries all
    bitboards to report exactly what pieces and stacks are on it.
  - **Visualize the full board:** A function that combines all piece bitboards
    to print a familiar, FEN-like representation of the entire game state.

Addressing these considerations is essential for transforming the powerful
theoretical design of the bitboard engine into a successful, robust, and
practical reality.
