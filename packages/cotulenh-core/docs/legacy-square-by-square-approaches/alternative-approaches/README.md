# Alternative Move Application Approaches

This folder contains comprehensive documentation for different approaches to
implementing move application and undo mechanisms in CoTuLenh.

## Problem Statement

CoTuLenh has complex move application requirements:

- **7+ different move types** (normal, capture, deploy-step, stay-capture,
  combine, etc.)
- **Heroic promotion logic** (single piece, multiple simultaneous, last piece
  rule)
- **Deploy session state management** (multi-step moves with partial state)
- **Perfect undo capability** for UI applications
- **Legal move filtering** (make move ‚Üí test legality ‚Üí undo)

## Approaches Documented

### 1. Mutable Make/Unmake Pattern

**File:** `mutable-make-unmake.md`

**What it solves:**

- ‚úÖ **Performance** - Fastest approach (10-15ms move generation)
- ‚úÖ **Memory efficiency** - Minimal allocations (2KB per position)
- ‚úÖ **Proven pattern** - Used by all chess engines
- ‚úÖ **Direct implementation** - No abstraction overhead

**Best for:**

- Performance-critical applications
- Teams with strong discipline and test coverage
- Single-threaded applications
- When you need maximum speed

**Challenges:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **State corruption risk** - Must perfectly restore all state
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Complex undo logic** - Every move type needs correct undo
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Testing overhead** - 100+ tests needed for state integrity

---

### 2. Command Pattern Approach

**File:** `command-pattern-approach.md`

**What it solves:**

- ‚úÖ **Composability** - Build complex moves from atomic actions
- ‚úÖ **Perfect undo guarantee** - Mathematically guaranteed if actions are
  correct
- ‚úÖ **Debugging** - Clear action sequences
- ‚úÖ **Testability** - Test atomic actions independently

**Best for:**

- Complex games with many move types (20+)
- Teams that prefer OOP patterns
- When you need move serialization/replay
- Applications requiring audit trails

**Challenges:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implementation complexity** - 15+ classes needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance overhead** - Object allocation per action
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Overkill for CoTuLenh** - Too much abstraction for 7 move types

---

### 3. Immutable State Approach

**File:** `immutable-state-approach.md`

**What it solves:**

- ‚úÖ **Correctness guarantee** - Impossible to corrupt state
- ‚úÖ **Simple testing** - No state restoration to test
- ‚úÖ **Parallelization** - Thread-safe by design
- ‚úÖ **Undo/redo trivial** - Just keep old states

**Best for:**

- UI applications where bugs are visible
- Multi-threaded applications
- Teams preferring functional programming
- When correctness is more important than performance

**Challenges:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance cost** - 30-50% slower than mutable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Memory overhead** - More allocations and GC pressure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cloning complexity** - Must correctly clone all state

---

### 4. Virtual State Overlay (Hybrid)

**File:** `virtual-state-overlay.md`

**What it solves:**

- ‚úÖ **Deploy session complexity** - Clean handling of partial states
- ‚úÖ **Unified code paths** - Same functions for normal and deploy moves
- ‚úÖ **Atomic commits** - Real state unchanged until deploy complete
- ‚úÖ **Clean history** - One entry per complete operation

**Best for:**

- Handling deploy sessions specifically
- When you need both safety and performance
- Complex multi-step operations
- Applications with transaction-like requirements

**Challenges:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implementation complexity** - Virtual board abstraction
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Memory overhead** - Virtual state tracking
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Debugging complexity** - Multiple state layers

---

## Heroic Promotion Integration

### Heroic Promotion Challenges

**File:** `heroic-promotion-integration.md`

All approaches must handle:

- **Multiple simultaneous promotions** (one move promotes 3+ pieces)
- **Deploy session promotions** (promotion during multi-step moves)
- **Last piece promotion** (HEADQUARTER becomes heroic when alone)
- **Perfect undo** (restore exact heroic state)

Each approach handles heroic promotion differently:

- **Mutable:** Track changes in UndoInfo
- **Command:** Atomic promotion actions
- **Immutable:** New state with updated heroic flags
- **Virtual:** Heroic changes in virtual overlay

## Performance Comparison

| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ----------- |
| **Mutable Make/Unmake** | üèÜ 10-15ms      | üèÜ 2KB       | ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex      | ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk     |

| **Immutable State**     | ‚úÖ 17-23ms      | ‚ö†Ô∏è 10KB      | ‚úÖ Simple       | üèÜ Perfect  |
| **Virtual Overlay**     | ‚úÖ 14-21ms      | ‚úÖ 4KB       | ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex      | ‚úÖ Good     |

## Recommendations by Use Case

### For CoTuLenh UI Application

**Recommended:** Mutable Make/Unmake with excellent test coverage

**Reasoning:**

- Performance difference is imperceptible for UI (10ms vs 20ms)
- Simpler than command pattern
- Current codebase already uses mutation
- Can add immutable public API later if needed

### For CoTuLenh AI Engine

**Recommended:** Mutable Make/Unmake

**Reasoning:**

- Performance is critical (millions of positions/second)
- Memory efficiency matters
- Single-threaded operation
- Proven pattern for game engines

### For Multi-Player Server

**Recommended:** Immutable State

**Reasoning:**

- Correctness is critical (bugs affect multiple users)
- May need parallelization
- Easier to reason about concurrent access
- Undo/redo for game replay

### For Deploy Session Specifically

**Recommended:** Virtual State Overlay

**Reasoning:**

- Deploy sessions are the hardest part of CoTuLenh
- Virtual overlay elegantly handles partial states
- Atomic commits prevent corruption
- Clean integration with any base approach
