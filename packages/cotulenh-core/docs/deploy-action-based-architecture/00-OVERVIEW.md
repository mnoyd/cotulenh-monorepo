# Action-Based Deploy Architecture - Overview

**Created**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: Design Discussion Phase  
**Purpose**: Simplified deploy architecture using action tracking instead of
virtual state

---

## üéØ Core Philosophy

**"Store Actions, Not State"**

Instead of maintaining dual state (virtual + real board), we:

1. Modify the **real board directly** during deployment
2. Track **actions taken** during deploy session
3. Use **action rollback** for undo/validation
4. Adapt **FEN and queries** to handle active deployment

---

## üîÑ Paradigm Shift

### Current Approach (Virtual State)

```typescript
// Virtual state overlay
class DeploySession {
  virtualChanges: Map<Square, Piece | null> // Temporary overlay

  commit() {
    // Apply all virtual changes to real board
    for (const [square, piece] of virtualChanges) {
      board.set(square, piece)
    }
  }
}
```

**Problems**:

- Dual state management complexity
- Need to sync virtual and real
- Commit logic fragile
- Queries need virtual board wrapper

---

### New Approach (Action-Based)

```typescript
// Action tracking
class DeploySession {
  actions: DeployAction[] // Record of what happened

  rollback() {
    // Undo actions in reverse order
    for (const action of actions.reverse()) {
      action.undo()
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:

- ‚úÖ Single source of truth (real board)
- ‚úÖ Simple undo = reverse actions
- ‚úÖ No sync issues
- ‚úÖ Direct state queries

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

### 1. Deploy Session Tracker

```typescript
interface DeploySession {
  stackSquare: Square // Where deployment started
  turn: Color // Who is deploying
  originalPiece: Piece // Original stack (for reference)
  actions: DeployAction[] // ‚Üê KEY: Actions taken
  startFEN: string // FEN before deploy started
}
```

### 2. Deploy Actions

```typescript
interface DeployAction {
  type: 'remove' | 'place' | 'move' | 'capture'
  square: Square
  piece?: Piece
  previousPiece?: Piece // For undo

  execute(): void
  undo(): void
}
```

### 3. Direct Board Mutation

```typescript
// Each deploy move modifies board immediately
game.move({ from: 'c3', to: 'c5', piece: 'n', deploy: true })
// ‚Üí Board at c3 updated (piece removed from stack)
// ‚Üí Board at c5 updated (Navy placed)
// ‚Üí Actions recorded in session
```

---

## üìä Key Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Real Board as Single Source of Truth

- **Rationale**: Simplicity, no sync issues
- **Trade-off**: Need to handle FEN during active deploy carefully
- **Impact**: Queries work directly on real board

### Decision 2: Action Recording

- **Rationale**: Enables rollback without storing duplicate state
- **Trade-off**: Must record enough info for undo
- **Impact**: Memory efficient, clear audit trail

### Decision 3: FEN Adaptation

- **Rationale**: FEN must represent active deploy state somehow
- **Options**:
  - Extended FEN with DEPLOY marker
  - Base FEN + separate deploy session info
  - Intermediate state FEN (current board as-is)
- **To Discuss**: Which approach?

### Decision 4: Move Validation During Deploy

- **Rationale**: Need to validate remaining pieces can stay
- **Approach**: Check after each action, before recording
- **Impact**: Fail fast, prevent invalid states

---

## üéÆ User Experience Flow

```typescript
// Initial: Stack at c3: (NFT)
game.board['c3'] = { type: 'n', carrying: [f, t] }

// ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ DEPLOY STEP 1 ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
game.move({ from: 'c3', to: 'c5', piece: 'n', deploy: true })

// Real board modified:
game.board['c3'] = { type: 'f', carrying: [t] } // Navy removed
game.board['c5'] = { type: 'n' } // Navy placed

// Deploy session created:
session = {
  stackSquare: 'c3',
  turn: 'r',
  originalPiece: NFT,
  actions: [
    { type: 'remove', square: 'c3', piece: Navy },
    { type: 'place', square: 'c5', piece: Navy },
  ],
  startFEN: '...',
}

// ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ DEPLOY STEP 2 ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
game.move({ from: 'c3', to: 'd4', piece: 'f', deploy: true })

// Real board modified again:
game.board['c3'] = { type: 't' } // Air Force removed
game.board['d4'] = { type: 'f' } // Air Force placed

// Actions accumulated:
session.actions.push(
  { type: 'remove', square: 'c3', piece: AirForce },
  { type: 'place', square: 'd4', piece: AirForce },
)

// ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ ROLLBACK (if needed) ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
game.undoDeployStep()
// ‚Üí Reverses last 2 actions
// ‚Üí Board restored to previous state
```

## üîç Critical Questions to Answer

### Q1: FEN Representation During Deploy

**Options**:

1. **Intermediate State FEN**: Return current board as-is
   - Pro: Simple, accurate to current state
   - Con: Doesn't show original stack, loses context
2. **Extended FEN with Marker**: Add `DEPLOY c3:FT 1` suffix
   - Pro: Complete information, can reconstruct session
   - Con: Non-standard, need parsing logic
3. **Virtual FEN**: Reconstruct as if no deploy happened
   - Pro: Clean, shows original position
   - Con: Misleading, doesn't match real board

**Recommendation**: Option 2 (Extended FEN) - See `01-FEN-HANDLING.md`

---

### Q2: Move Generation During Deploy

**Current**: Only generate moves from deploying stack

**With Action-Based**:

- Stack is being modified incrementally
- How do we know what pieces remain?
- Need to track remaining pieces separately?

**Options**:

1. Calculate from actions: `original - moved = remaining`
2. Track explicitly in session: `remainingPieces: Piece[]`
3. Read from current board at stack square

**Recommendation**: Option 1 (calculate) - See `02-MOVE-GENERATION.md`

---

### Q3: Validation During Deploy

**Critical**: Ensure remaining pieces can legally stay on terrain

**Approach**:

```typescript
function validateDeployStep(session: DeploySession, action: DeployAction) {
  // Calculate what will remain after this action
  const remaining = calculateRemaining(session, action)

  // Check terrain compatibility
  if (remaining.length > 0) {
    const canStay = validateTerrainForPieces(session.stackSquare, remaining)
    if (!canStay) {
      throw new Error('Invalid deploy: remaining pieces cannot stay')
    }
  }
}
```

**Details**: See `03-VALIDATION.md`

---

### Q4: History Management

**Current**: Each deploy step is separate history entry

**With Action-Based**:

- Option A: Keep separate entries (simple undo)
- Option B: Group into transaction (cleaner history)
- Option C: Deploy session IS the history entry

**Recommendation**: Option A initially, migrate to C later - See `04-HISTORY.md`

---

### Q5: Recombine Moves

**Gap**: Pieces cannot rejoin deployed stacks

**With Action-Based**:

- Track deployed squares in session
- Generate moves to deployed squares (if in range)
- Action: Move + Combine

**Details**: See `05-RECOMBINE.md`
