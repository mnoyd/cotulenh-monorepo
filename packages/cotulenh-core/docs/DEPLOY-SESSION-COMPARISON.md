# Deploy System: Current vs Action-Based Comparison

## Quick Visual Comparison

### Current Implementation (State-Based)

```typescript
// What gets stored
type DeployState = {
  stackSquare: number
  turn: Color
  originalPiece: Piece        // Navy(AirForce,Tank)
  movedPieces: Piece[]        // [Navy, AirForce] ‚ùå No destination info
  stay?: Piece[]
}

// Problems
‚ùå Lost move destinations
‚ùå Lost move order
‚ùå Lost capture information
‚ùå Cannot reconstruct history
‚ùå Cannot generate proper SAN
‚ùå Difficult recombine support
```

### Action-Based Architecture

```typescript
// What gets stored
class DeploySession {
  stackSquare: number
  turn: Color
  originalPiece: Piece        // Navy(AirForce,Tank)
  actions: InternalMove[]     // [
                              //   { from: c3, to: c5, piece: Navy },
                              //   { from: c3, to: d4, piece: AirForce, flags: CAPTURE }
                              // ] ‚úÖ Complete history
  startFEN: string            // ‚úÖ Can restore original state

  getRemainingPieces() {      // ‚úÖ Calculate dynamically
    // Original - moved = remaining
  }
}

// Benefits
‚úÖ Complete move history preserved
‚úÖ Can generate accurate SAN notation
‚úÖ Easy recombine implementation
‚úÖ Better undo/redo support
‚úÖ Extended FEN serialization
‚úÖ Clear audit trail
```

## Example Scenario

### Setup

```
Stack at c3: Navy(AirForce, Tank)
```

### User Actions

1. Deploy Navy to c5
2. Deploy AirForce to d4 (captures enemy)
3. Deploy Tank to e5

---

## Current System (State-Based)

### After Step 1

```typescript
deployState = {
  stackSquare: c3,
  originalPiece: Navy(AirForce, Tank),
  movedPieces: [Navy], // ‚ùå Where did it go? Unknown!
}
```

### After Step 2

```typescript
deployState = {
  stackSquare: c3,
  originalPiece: Navy(AirForce, Tank),
  movedPieces: [Navy, AirForce], // ‚ùå Which captured? Unknown!
}
```

### After Step 3

```typescript
deployState = null // Session complete, turn switched
// ‚ùå All history lost! Cannot reconstruct what happened
```

### Issues

- üö´ **SAN Generation**: Cannot create `"Nc5,Fxd4,Te5"` - don't know
  destinations
- üö´ **Recombine**: Cannot track where Navy/AirForce went
- üö´ **Undo**: Can only undo entire sequence, not individual steps
- üö´ **History**: Lost all information about what happened

---

## Action-Based System

### After Step 1

```typescript
session = {
  stackSquare: c3,
  originalPiece: Navy(AirForce, Tank),
  actions: [{ from: c3, to: c5, piece: Navy, flags: DEPLOY }],
  startFEN: '...fen before deploy...',
}

// ‚úÖ Can calculate: remaining = Tank
// ‚úÖ Can generate SAN: "Nc5..."
// ‚úÖ Can recombine: AirForce can rejoin Navy at c5
```

### After Step 2

```typescript
session = {
  stackSquare: c3,
  originalPiece: Navy(AirForce, Tank),
  actions: [
    { from: c3, to: c5, piece: Navy, flags: DEPLOY },
    { from: c3, to: d4, piece: AirForce, flags: DEPLOY | CAPTURE, captured: {...} }
  ],
  startFEN: "...fen before deploy..."
}

// ‚úÖ remaining = Tank
// ‚úÖ SAN: "Nc5,Fxd4..."
// ‚úÖ Can recombine Tank with Navy at c5 or AirForce at d4
```

### After Step 3 (Commit)

```typescript
history.push({
  type: 'DEPLOY',
  from: c3,
  actions: [
    { from: c3, to: c5, piece: Navy, flags: DEPLOY },
    { from: c3, to: d4, piece: AirForce, flags: DEPLOY | CAPTURE, captured: {...} },
    { from: c3, to: e5, piece: Tank, flags: DEPLOY }
  ],
  san: "Nc5,Fxd4,Te5",
  startFEN: "...fen before...",
  endFEN: "...fen after..."
})

// ‚úÖ Complete history preserved in one transaction
// ‚úÖ Can undo entire deployment
// ‚úÖ Can replay moves
// ‚úÖ Can display in UI with full details
```

### Benefits

- ‚úÖ **SAN Generation**: Perfect `"Nc5,Fxd4,Te5"` from full history
- ‚úÖ **Recombine**: Know Navy@c5, AirForce@d4, Tank@e5 - can generate all valid
  recombines
- ‚úÖ **Undo**: Can undo entire deployment OR individual steps during session
- ‚úÖ **History**: Complete audit trail of deployment

## Code Impact Comparison

### Current: SetDeployStateAction Execute

```typescript
execute(): void {
  this.oldDeployState = this.game.getDeployState()

  // Complex logic to calculate completion
  const updatedMovedPiece = [
    ...this.oldDeployState.movedPieces,
    ...this.newDeployState.movedPieces,
  ]

  const originalLen = flattenPiece(this.oldDeployState.originalPiece).length

  // Check if complete
  if (updatedMovedPiece.length + (this.oldDeployState.stay?.length ?? 0) === originalLen) {
    this.game.setDeployState(null)
    this.game['_turn'] = swapColor(this.oldDeployState.turn)
    return
  }

  // Update state
  this.game.setDeployState({
    stackSquare: this.oldDeployState.stackSquare,
    turn: this.oldDeployState.turn,
    originalPiece: this.oldDeployState.originalPiece,
    movedPieces: updatedMovedPiece,
    stay: this.oldDeployState.stay,
  })
}
```

**Lines of code**: ~25  
**Complexity**: High - mixed concerns  
**Maintainability**: Low - difficult to understand

### Action-Based: SetDeploySessionAction Execute

```typescript
execute(): void {
  this.oldSession = this.game.getDeploySession()
  this.game.setDeploySession(this.newSession)

  // Auto-complete if done
  if (this.newSession && this.newSession.isComplete()) {
    this.game.setDeploySession(null)
    this.game['_turn'] = swapColor(this.newSession.turn)
  }
}
```

**Lines of code**: ~7  
**Complexity**: Low - single responsibility  
**Maintainability**: High - clear and simple

**Improvement**: 71% less code, much clearer logic

## Recombine Move Example

### Scenario

```
1. Navy deploys to c5
2. User wants to rejoin AirForce with Navy at c5
```

### Current System

```typescript
// ‚ùå How do we know Navy is at c5?
// movedPieces = [Navy] but no destination!
// Cannot generate recombine moves effectively
```

### Action-Based System

```typescript
session.getDeployedSquares()
// ‚Üí [c5]

// Generate recombine move:
{
  from: c3,
  to: c5,           // ‚úÖ Know Navy is here
  piece: AirForce,
  flags: DEPLOY | COMBINATION,
  combined: Navy(AirForce)
}

// When executed, updates session:
session.actions = [
  { from: c3, to: c5, piece: Navy },
  { from: c3, to: c5, piece: AirForce, flags: DEPLOY | COMBINATION }
]

// ‚úÖ Clear history: Navy deployed, then AirForce joined it
```

---

## Extended FEN Example

### Current System

```typescript
// During deployment:
game.fen() ‚Üí "...normal fen..."
// ‚ùå No way to know deployment is active!
// ‚ùå Cannot save/load mid-deployment
```

### Action-Based System

```typescript
// During deployment:
game.fen() ‚Üí "...base fen... DEPLOY c3:Nc5,Fxd4..."

// Can parse back:
const game = CoTuLenh.fromFEN("...base fen... DEPLOY c3:Nc5,Fxd4...")
// ‚úÖ Reconstructs deployment session perfectly
// ‚úÖ UI knows to show deploy mode
// ‚úÖ Can save/load games mid-deployment
```

## Migration Path

### Step 1: Add DeploySession class

```bash
# No breaking changes
‚úÖ Old code keeps working
‚úÖ New code can use DeploySession
```

### Step 2: Update internal usage

```bash
# Internal refactoring
‚úÖ Tests keep passing
‚úÖ API unchanged
```

### Step 3: Add new features

```bash
# Enable new capabilities
‚úÖ Extended FEN
‚úÖ Better recombine
‚úÖ Improved SAN
```

### Step 4: Deprecate old API

```bash
# Eventually remove DeployState
‚úÖ getDeployState() marked @deprecated
‚úÖ Migration guide provided
```

## Conclusion

**Action-based architecture is clearly superior because:**

1. **Complete Information**: Stores full move history, not just pieces
2. **Better Features**: Extended FEN, proper SAN, full recombine support
3. **Simpler Code**: 71% less code in critical paths
4. **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **No Downsides**: Performance roughly same, memory increase minimal

**Recommendation**: **Proceed with refactoring immediately**

The existing documentation provides a complete implementation guide:

- `ACTION-BASED-DEPLOY-REFACTORING-SPEC.md` - Complete specification
- `docs/deploy-action-based-architecture/` - Architecture details
- Estimated time: 15-22 hours (2-3 days)
