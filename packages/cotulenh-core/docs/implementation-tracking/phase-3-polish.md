# Phase 3: Polish (Week 3)

**Goal:** Edge cases, documentation, final validation  
**Duration:** 5 days  
**Status:** üî¥ Not Started  
**Prerequisites:** Phase 2 Checkpoint MUST pass

---

## Task 3.1: Edge Case Testing

**Time:** 2-3 days

### Edge Cases to Test

1. **Empty board**

   - Air defense should be empty
   - No errors or crashes

2. **Board full of air defense**

   - Entire board covered
   - Performance still good

3. **Heroic promotion mid-game**

   - Tank becomes heroic (radius 1 ‚Üí 2)
   - Air defense expands correctly

4. **Piece capture**

   - Air defense piece captured
   - Coverage updates correctly

5. **Deploy sessions with air defense**

   - Deploy moves respect air defense
   - Cache invalidates correctly

6. **Undo/redo chain**

   - Multiple undo/redo operations
   - Air defense stays consistent

7. **Edge squares**

   - Air defense at corners (a0, l11, etc.)
   - Circles clip correctly

8. **Multiple pieces same square (stacks)**
   - Air defense calculated correctly
   - No double-counting

### Steps

1. Create `test/edge-cases/air-defense-edge-cases.test.ts`
2. Write test for each edge case above
3. Fix any bugs found
4. Verify all pass

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File exists with 8+ edge case tests
- [ ] All edge cases pass
- [ ] Bugs fixed (if any found)
- [ ] Coverage for corner cases

### Verification

```bash
npm test -- edge-cases/air-defense
```

## Task 3.2: Documentation

**Time:** 1-2 days

### Documents to Create/Update

#### 1. `docs/HYBRID_BITBOARD_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Content:**

- Overview of hybrid approach
- Why bitboards for air defense
- How it works (high-level)
- Performance improvements
- API reference
- Code examples

#### 2. Update `README.md`

Add section about hybrid architecture:

```markdown
## Architecture

CoTuLenh uses a hybrid board representation:

- **Mailbox (0x88)**: Primary board state
- **Bitboards**: Air defense zone calculation

This provides 25-50x faster air defense checks while maintaining code simplicity
for other operations.
```

#### 3. Code Comments

Add JSDoc comments to:

- `BitboardUtils` class
- `CircleMasks` class
- `AirDefenseBitboard` class
- Public methods in CoTuLenh

#### 4. Migration Guide (if applicable)

If API changed, document:

- What changed
- How to migrate
- Backward compatibility notes

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `docs/HYBRID_BITBOARD_ARCHITECTURE.md` exists
- [ ] README updated
- [ ] All public APIs documented with JSDoc
- [ ] Migration guide if needed
- [ ] Code examples work

### Verification

```bash
# Check docs exist
ls -la docs/HYBRID_BITBOARD_ARCHITECTURE.md

# Generate API docs (if you have tools)
npm run docs
```
