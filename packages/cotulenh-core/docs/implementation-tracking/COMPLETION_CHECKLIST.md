## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality

- [ ] Bitboard type defined and working
- [ ] Square ↔ bit conversion works
- [ ] Bitboard operations (popCount, isSet, etc.) work
- [ ] Circle masks pre-computed for radius 1, 2, 3
- [ ] Circle masks slide to any position correctly
- [ ] Air defense calculated from CoTuLenh instance
- [ ] Air defense coverage correct for all piece types
- [ ] Heroic pieces have correct ranges

### Integration

- [ ] Cache added to CoTuLenh class
- [ ] Cache invalidates on moves
- [ ] Cache doesn't invalidate unnecessarily
- [ ] All air defense checks use bitboards
- [ ] Air Force move generation respects air defense
- [ ] Undo/redo works correctly with cache

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Empty board handled
- [ ] Full board handled
- [ ] Corner positions clip correctly
- [ ] Heroic promotion works
- [ ] Piece capture updates correctly
- [ ] Deploy sessions work with air defense
- [ ] Stack handling correct
