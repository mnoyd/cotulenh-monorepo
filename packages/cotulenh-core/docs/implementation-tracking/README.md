# Hybrid Bitboard Implementation Tracking

**Project:** Add bitboard-based air defense to existing mailbox CoTuLenh  
**Approach:** Hybrid (keep mailbox, add bitboards for air defense only)  
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks  
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started

---

## 📋 Overview

This folder tracks the implementation of hybrid bitboard architecture for
CoTuLenh. Each phase has its own detailed document with specific tasks,
acceptance criteria, and verification steps.

### What We're Building

- **Keep:** Existing mailbox (0x88) board representation
- **Add:** Bitboard air defense zone calculation
- **Goal:** 25-50x faster air defense checks
- **Risk:** Low (additive only, no breaking changes)

## 🎯 Implementation Phases

| Phase       | Document                                        | Status         | Checkpoint                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1** | [Week 1: Foundation](./phase-1-foundation.md)   | 🔴 Not Started | Bitboard utils + circle masks working   |
| **Phase 2** | [Week 2: Integration](./phase-2-integration.md) | 🔴 Not Started | Air defense using bitboards in CoTuLenh |
| **Phase 3** | [Week 3: Polish](./phase-3-polish.md)           | 🔴 Not Started | All tests passing, documented           |

## 📝 How to Use This Tracker

### For AI Agents

1. **Read the current phase document** (e.g., `phase-1-foundation.md`)
2. **Check progress tracker** above to see which task is next
3. **Follow the task steps** exactly as written
4. **Verify acceptance criteria** before marking complete
5. **Update progress** in both this file and phase file
6. **Run checkpoint validation** before moving to next phase

### For Humans

1. **Open current phase document** to see detailed tasks
2. **Work through tasks sequentially** - don't skip ahead
3. **Verify each task** using the acceptance criteria
4. **Mark tasks complete** by checking the box
5. **Run checkpoint tests** before proceeding
6. **Update status** in this README

### Rules

- ✅ **DO:** Complete tasks in order
- ✅ **DO:** Verify before marking complete
- ✅ **DO:** Run all checkpoint tests
- ❌ **DON'T:** Skip tasks
- ❌ **DON'T:** Assume something works without testing
- ❌ **DON'T:** Move to next phase without passing checkpoint

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Quick Health Check

```bash
# Run all bitboard tests
npm test -- bitboard

# Check if files exist
ls -la src/bitboard/
ls -la test/bitboard/
```

### Phase Checkpoints

```bash
# Checkpoint 1: Foundation
npm test -- bitboard-utils
npm test -- circle-masks
npm test -- air-defense-bitboard

# Checkpoint 2: Integration
npm test -- integration/air-defense

# Checkpoint 3: All tests
npm test
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Bitboard

A `bigint` representing the 12×12 board where each bit represents a square.

### Circle Mask

Pre-computed bitboard representing a circle of radius 1, 2, or 3.

### Air Defense Coverage

A bitboard with all squares covered by enemy air defense pieces.

### Hybrid Architecture

Using mailbox (0x88 array) for primary representation, bitboards only for air
defense zones.

## 📞 Need Help?

- **Stuck on a task?** Check the acceptance criteria again
- **Test failing?** Read the error message and trace back to the code
- **Not sure what to do?** Re-read the current phase document
- **Ready for checkpoint?** Run ALL tests for that phase before proceeding
