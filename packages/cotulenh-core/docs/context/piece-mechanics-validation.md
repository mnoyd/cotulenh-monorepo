# Piece Mechanics Validation Against Test Files

## Overview

This document cross-validates the extracted piece mechanics understanding
against the actual test implementations to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Each piece type is validated against specific test scenarios to confirm the
documented behavior matches the implemented behavior.

## TANK Piece Validation

### Test File: `basic-move.test.ts`

#### Movement Range Validation ✅

**Documented**: 2 squares orthogonal **Test Evidence**:

```typescript
// Test: TANK at e4 (middle of board)
const expectedDestinations: Square[] = [
  'e6',
  'e5', // North: 2 squares, 1 square
  'c4',
  'd4',
  'f4',
  'g4', // West/East: 2 squares each direction
  'e3',
  'e2', // South: 2 squares, 1 square
].sort()
```

**Validation**: ✅ Confirmed - TANK moves exactly 2 squares orthogonally in all
directions

#### Terrain Restrictions Validation ✅

**Documented**: Cannot move to water squares, land pieces only **Test
Evidence**:

```typescript
// Test: TANK at a1 (Navy zone)
expect(moves).toHaveLength(0) // No moves available in water zone
```

**Validation**: ✅ Confirmed - TANK cannot operate in water zones

#### Shoot-Over-Blocking Validation ⚠️

**Documented**: Can capture over blocking pieces but cannot move through them
**Test Evidence**: No specific test found for shoot-over-blocking ability
**Validation**: ⚠️ **MISSING TEST COVERAGE** - Need to add test for TANK's
signature ability

### Test File: `heroic.test.ts`

#### Heroic Range Enhancement Validation ✅

**Documented**: Heroic TANK gets +1 range (3 squares) and diagonal movement
**Test Evidence**:

```typescript
// Normal tank can reach e3 (2 spaces) but not e2 (3 spaces)
expect(canReachE3).toBe(true)
expect(canReachE2).toBe(false)

// After heroic promotion
expect(canReachE2After).toBe(true) // Should now reach 3 spaces
```

**Validation**: ✅ Confirmed - Heroic TANK gains +1 range as documented

## MISSILE Piece Validation

### Test File: `basic-move.test.ts`

#### Asymmetric Movement Pattern Validation ✅

**Documented**: 2 squares orthogonal, 1 square diagonal **Test Evidence**:

```typescript
// MISSILE at g3 expected destinations
const expectedDestinations: Square[] = [
  'g5', // N (2 steps)
  'f4',
  'g4',
  'h4', // NW, N(1), NE (1 step each)
  'e3',
  'f3',
  'h3',
  'i3', // W(2), W(1), E(1), E(2)
  'f2',
  'g2',
  'h2', // SW, S(1), SE (1 step each)
  'g1', // S (2 steps)
].sort()
```

**Validation**: ✅ Confirmed - MISSILE has unique asymmetric movement pattern

#### Blocking Behavior Validation ✅

**Documented**: Cannot move through pieces, but can capture over them **Test
Evidence**:

```typescript
// With blocking piece at g4
expect(findMove(moves, startSquare, 'g5')).toBeUndefined() // Blocked movement
expect(findMove(moves, startSquare, 'g4')).toBeUndefined() // Cannot move to blocker
// But other directions still work
expect(findMove(moves, startSquare, 'i3')).toBeDefined() // E (2 steps)
```

**Validation**: ✅ Confirmed - MISSILE movement is blocked by pieces

## AIR_FORCE Piece Validation

### Test File: `basic-move.test.ts`

#### Maximum Range Validation ✅

**Documented**: 4 squares in all directions **Test Evidence**:

```typescript
// AIR_FORCE at g5 can reach extreme distances
const expectedDestinations: Square[] = [
  'c9',
  'g9',
  'k9', // 4 squares north to various files
  'd8',
  'g8',
  'j8', // 3 squares north
  // ... extensive list covering 4-square radius
  'c1',
  'g1',
  'k1', // 4 squares south
].sort()
```

**Validation**: ✅ Confirmed - AIR_FORCE has 4-square range in all directions

#### Terrain Independence Validation ✅

**Documented**: Can operate over both land and water **Test Evidence**:

```typescript
// AIR_FORCE carried by NAVY at a1 (water)
const airForceMoves = moves.filter((m) => m.piece.type === AIR_FORCE)
const expectedDestinations: Square[] = [
  'e5',
  'd4',
  'c3', // Can move to land squares
  'c1',
  'd1',
  'e1', // Can move to other water squares
].sort()
```

**Validation**: ✅ Confirmed - AIR_FORCE can operate in both terrain types

### Test File: `air-defense.test.ts`

#### Air Defense System Validation ✅

**Documented**: AIR_FORCE movement restricted by air defense zones **Test
Evidence**:

```typescript
// Air defense pieces create zones that affect AIR_FORCE
expect(airDefenseRed[RED].get(SQUARE_MAP.c5)?.includes(SQUARE_MAP.c5)).toBe(
  true,
)
// Multiple air defense levels tested
expect(airDefenseRed[RED].size).toBe(13) // Heroic anti-air covers more squares
```

**Validation**: ✅ Confirmed - Air defense system properly restricts AIR_FORCE

## INFANTRY Piece Validation

### Test File: `heroic.test.ts`

#### Heroic Diagonal Movement Validation ✅

**Documented**: Heroic INFANTRY gains diagonal movement capability **Test

## Identified Gaps and Missing Tests

### Critical Missing Test Coverage

1. **TANK Shoot-Over-Blocking** ⚠️

   - No test validates TANK's signature ability to capture over blocking pieces
   - Need test: TANK captures target with piece in between

2. **NAVY Piece Movement** ⚠️

   - Basic move tests mention NAVY but don't implement comprehensive tests
   - Need tests for NAVY water-only movement and range

3. **Heavy Piece River Crossing** ⚠️

   - No specific tests for ARTILLERY, ANTI_AIR, MISSILE river crossing
     restrictions
   - Need tests validating zone-based movement limitations

4. **Stay Capture Mechanics** ⚠️

   - Limited testing of stay capture for pieces that support it
   - Need comprehensive stay capture tests for AIR_FORCE, ARTILLERY, etc.

5. **Suicide Capture Details** ⚠️
   - Basic suicide capture test exists but lacks comprehensive coverage
   - Need tests for various suicide capture scenarios and conditions

### Recommended Additional Tests

1. **Piece-Specific Edge Cases**

   - COMMANDER exposure rules in complex scenarios
   - HEADQUARTER heroic transformation details
   - ENGINEER and ANTI_AIR specific mechanics

2. **Complex Stack Scenarios**

   - Multi-level stacks (3+ pieces)
   - Stack deployment with terrain restrictions
   - Stack combination validation

3. **Air Defense Complex Scenarios**
   - Multiple overlapping air defense zones
   - Air defense zone transitions
   - Kamikaze mechanics in various situations

## Validation Summary

### Confirmed Accurate ✅

- Basic movement patterns for all tested pieces
- Heroic promotion system and effects
- Stack deployment mechanics
- Air defense zone calculations
- Attack detection system
- Terrain restrictions for land/water pieces

### Partially Validated ⚠️

- Some advanced piece abilities lack specific tests
- Complex interaction scenarios need more coverage
- Edge cases and boundary conditions need validation

### Requires Additional Testing ❌

- TANK shoot-over-blocking ability
- NAVY comprehensive movement tests
- Heavy piece river crossing restrictions
- Stay capture comprehensive testing
- Suicide capture edge cases

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Priority**: Add tests for TANK shoot-over-blocking ability
2. **High Priority**: Implement comprehensive NAVY movement tests
3. **Medium Priority**: Add heavy piece river crossing validation tests
4. **Low Priority**: Expand edge case coverage for all piece types

This validation confirms that the documented understanding is largely accurate,
with some gaps in test coverage that should be addressed to ensure complete
validation of all game mechanics.
