## Documentation Structure

### Current Organization (Flat)

All 40+ documents currently in root `/context` directory. This is **acceptable**
because:

‚úÖ **Pros:**

- Easy to find any document (no navigation needed)
- All links work without path changes
- Simple for AI agents to list and read all files
- No subdirectory navigation complexity

‚ùå **Cons:**

- No visual organization by category
- Harder to see document relationships at a glance

### Recommended Future Organization (Optional)

If you want better visual organization, can move to:

## Questions to Test Understanding

After reading the documentation, can you answer:

### Basic (Must Know)

1. How many files and ranks on the CoTuLenh board?
2. What are the three terrain zones?
3. How many piece types exist?
4. What triggers heroic promotion?
5. What is the flying general rule?

### Intermediate (Should Know)

6. How do stacks move - by carrier or carried piece rules?
7. What are the three capture types?
8. How does air defense affect air force movement?
9. Which pieces cannot cross the river (under what conditions)?
10. What makes MISSILE piece unique in its movement?

### Advanced (Deep Understanding)

11. How do you generate all possible stack split configurations?
12. What is the exact formula for air defense zone coverage?
13. How does heroic status affect HEADQUARTER piece differently than others?
14. What are the exact conditions for a stay-capture vs normal capture?
15. How is deploy state tracked and when does it end?

**If you can answer 12+/15 correctly, you're ready to implement.**

## What's Still in TypeScript Implementation

Some aspects remain TypeScript-specific (not needed for porting):

‚ùå **Not Needed for Porting:**

- codebase-dependencies.md - TypeScript class structure
- Singleton pattern details
- LRU cache implementation
- Command pattern specifics
- TypeScript interface definitions

‚úÖ **Needed for Porting (Concepts, Not Code):**

- Move generation algorithms (language-agnostic)
- Validation logic (rules)
- State management patterns (general)
- Data flow concepts (architecture)

---

## Summary

**Before:**

- 40+ excellent documents in flat directory
- No clear entry point for porting
- Mixed implementation and rules
- No validation checklist

**After:**

- Clear entry point: PORTING-GUIDE.md
- Implementation-agnostic approach
- 118-point validation checklist
- Structured reading paths
- Language flexibility emphasized
- All existing content preserved

**Result:** AI agents can now efficiently learn CoTuLenh for cross-language
porting in ~5-6 hours with confidence they have complete knowledge.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Read PORTING-GUIDE.md** - Understand the full scope
2. **Complete IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md** - Validate your knowledge
3. **Choose your architecture** - OOP, functional, data-oriented, or hybrid
4. **Start implementation** - Begin with board + basic pieces
5. **Test incrementally** - Use provided test cases

**Ready to port CoTuLenh to your language of choice!** üöÄ
